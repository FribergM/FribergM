## 👋 Hey there! I’m Måns Friberg

I’m a passionate software developer who loves diving into the world of backend development. There's something incredibly satisfying about creating the engine that powers applications! Lately, I’ve been exploring frontend development as well, so I can craft complete web applications that not only function well but also have something to actually look at instead of just a terminal (As alot of my projects have been in the past...).

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me indulging in my love for games. Whether it’s playing or thinking about game mechanics, I’m always excited about how technology can bring stories to life.

## 🎮 What I’m Up To:
🛠️ Building complete web applications.
🌱 Learning new frameworks and tools to expand my skill set.
